 Blockchain Security 2Go Example App for iOS
===

This project contains an iOS app showcasing interaction with Ethereum using 
the Infineon Blockchain Security 2Go starter kit contactless cards.

Currently the features are available to demonstrate Ethereum key representations 
using the Infineon Blockchain Security 2Go starter kit cards:  
- create five keys 
- visualize the keys as an ethereum address (QR-Code)


If you want to have more information on Infineon's Blockchain Security 2Go starter kit visit the [official Website](https://www.infineon.com/blockchain) and the [BlockchainSecurity 2Go github repository](https://github.com/Infineon/blockchain).

How it works
---

The app is communicating with the card via NFC to generate new private/public keys, 
read the public keys and visualizes the Ethereum address with an QR-Code.
